# application getting started at index.js file

# in index.js file i have wrapped App component

# in App.js i have wrapped Admin component where the actual functionality gets started

# in Admin.js all the required functions were defined

# the UserItem component is to display each user details

# this code not up to the level that the assignment required. if i get a chance to write this for some more time I will do it with all the functionalities that are required.
